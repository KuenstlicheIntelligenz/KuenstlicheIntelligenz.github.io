**Work in progress**

# Why don't we use Mean and Max Pooling?
IDEA: Probably cause the feature vector would be to long. -> GeM
But what about using both and doing an autoencoder on it, the network could select and weight each
feature on its own.

# Why do we use 2d 3x3 convolutional filter on the first 3 rgb channels?

# Why don't we have color invariant features, or have to learn them?
Has humans we can recognize a wasp in a picture, no matter in what colors it is shown.
