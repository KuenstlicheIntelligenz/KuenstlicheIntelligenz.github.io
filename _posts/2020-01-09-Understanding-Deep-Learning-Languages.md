# NLP
- Tokenization: Split text into individual text building blocks ( words, punctation, ...) after specialized rules.
- Tagging: Like in school, tag the words as nouns or verbs and it dependencies ( what is doing something in a sentence 
with subject object and verb)
- Lemmatization: Get the base form of a word
- Named Entities: Understanding that a name might be referring to a company ( e.g. Apple can mean the fruit or the company )
- Word vectors and similarity: Generate a multidimensional vector for a word which allows the word to be compared to another word.

# SOD - Salient object detection
> Salient object detection is a task based on a visual attention mechanism, 
> in which algorithms aim to explore objects or regions more attentive than the surrounding areas on the scene or images.

# Pooling
Using mean or max pooling to gain translational invariance over the pooled reagion.
For image retrieval max < mean < gem

## Max Pooling - MAC
More invariant to scale change because the max will not change with scale. But more affected by distractors ( a car which
is not needed for scene reconstruction )

## Mean pooling
Not so sensitive to distractors but suffers from scale change

## R-MAC 
Define multiple regions for feature maps and take the max.  

# Dealing with data imbalance

## Focal loss



# So far this is just for me

- Leveraging an intermediate level of representation:  
___
    Usually means to cut of the network at some layer and get the features
  
- Semantic information about the categories to classify:  
    Descriptive information about the category e.g. as an numeric vector. The values of the vector describe an image.

Kann ich mal testen wie das hier funktioniert. Wir rÃ¼cke ich denn ein?  

    Just with tab
```python
import os
test = 1
```
