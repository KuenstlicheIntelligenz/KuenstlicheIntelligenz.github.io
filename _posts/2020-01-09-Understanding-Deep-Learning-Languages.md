# SOD - Salient object detection
> Salient object detection is a task based on a visual attention mechanism, 
> in which algorithms aim to explore objects or regions more attentive than the surrounding areas on the scene or images.

# Pooling
Using mean or max pooling to gain translational invariance over the pooled reagion.
For image retrieval max < mean < gem

## Max Pooling - MAC
More invariant to scale change because the max will not change with scale. But more affected by distractors ( a car which
is not needed for scene reconstruction )

## Mean pooling
Not so sensitive to distractors but suffers from scale change

# R-MAC 
Define multiple regions for feature maps and take the max.  




# So far this is just for me

- Leveraging an intermediate level of representation:  
___
    Usually means to cut of the network at some layer and get the features
  
- Semantic information about the categories to classify:  
    Descriptive information about the category e.g. as an numeric vector. The values of the vector describe an image.

Kann ich mal testen wie das hier funktioniert. Wir rÃ¼cke ich denn ein?  

    Just with tab
```python
import os
test = 1
```
