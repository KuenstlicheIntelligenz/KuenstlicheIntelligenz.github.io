# My trip to Asia and what not to do again

## TL/DR
- Dont lie down under the cold stream of the ventilation system.
- Be sure to have the right conversion rate in mind.
- Sending something back to your homedestination may be expensive. Remember that.
- We were said that locals pay max 200 Dollar for a faked Honda Win in a very good state.
- Change money only at banks. Be sure to check rates and if you need to change, only small amounts.
- Always make clear what things cost. You may not feel like asking beforhand but DO IT!
- Learn bargaining and start with at least half of the price.
- Get a bag with waist strap!


## My Trip

I made my trip with two friends from university. I call them Dr. Frank and Alan. They are both good friends of mine and we get along well together, which is advantagous for a longer trip. Though this trip wasn't really long, three weeks should be considered the least amount of time to travel to asia.
 
Our first flight went from Duesseldorf to Beijing with a stopover of ~eight? hours. There we tried to sleep until our next flight. Stupidly enough, we laid ourselves right in the cold stream of the ventilation system. Instead of moving ten meters we countered it by digging ourselfs deeper under our jackets.

Our connecting flight to bangkok was delayed. Therefore we roughly had one afternoon to discover it. Arrived we went by a train to the city and started to search for an ATM. There happend the first big brain story moment. Smart as i am i drew 33.000 Baht instead of 3000, which roughly equals the amount of 1000 Euro. This was gonna be a good night in Bangkok...

On the way to our hostel a never ending stream of Tuk Tuks and Taxis nagged us to drive with them. We ended up taking a Tuk Tuk, experiencing a our first near death experience. A three-wheeled metal cage, with exposed engine and selfmade breaking lights. Without belts we overtook other "car" like things to the left and the right. To feel near-death experiences in the asian traffic is normal for a rule habitual european. Just relax and let it flow. You'll be fine. Probably. (Really, this is one thing i like about traveling. You have to learn to let go and not get stressed. You grow by this!)

Alan told us the Khao San Road is a must go in Bangkok. This road is a chaotic, way too loud and way to crowded party Street. Peoply try to get you to either buy something, to go in to their places or sell you ladies. Its like playing Pokemon in high grass and continuously being attackt by irritating locals. A repellent spray would be good...

Many online blogs post that this is a street for meeting fellow backpaker. I doubt that. You go there to see it and then you want to leave this place as soon as possible.

Our next flight went to DaNang International Airport. DaNang is an hour ride with the taxi to Hoi An where we stayed at a hostel. Hoi An is famous for their Tailors. Of course we had some suits tailored. Here we stepped into another trap. Most backpackers drive from south to the north, but we reversed the way, so we couldnt take more luggage and had to sent the items per mail. The Tailor said thats not a problem and we believed her naively. We had our Suits made and the our tailor lady called someone from the post office. Then she hit us with the price. I forgot what it was exactly, but you certainly could add half of the price of the suit ontop of the costs. Not that its much in general, because the suits where very cheap, but certainly suprising.

They faked our invoice, so we hopefully do not have to pay taxes in our country. ;)

We tryied to buy some Honda Wins. We talked to a local and she took as through narrow passageways to a house where another local was selling Motorbikes and especially Honda Wins. I did bad at bargaining and couldnt lower the price. He wanted ~280$ for the faked one. Alan was more lucky, he got one from a Backpacker.
